## The Algorithms- #100DaysOfCode (Challenge)

Created on: (28/05/2021)

This repo contains all the Algorithms which I tried to implement while reading from â€œIntroduction to Algorithms (Third Edition) from Thomas H. Cormen, and I am also trying the [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hashtag_click&f=live) [#100daysofcodechallenge](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100daysofcodechallenge&src=typeahead_click&f=live) [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge where I will try to code continuously for 100 days given the minimum amount of hours per day is 2-3 hours and I will also neatly keep a log of what I did for each day and also tweet the same.

Hoping this makes me a good dev and learner.

#### comments:

I thought i can implement all of the sorting algorithms, b
ut i was only able to implement 2 of them, so i thought I shall revisit the DSA.

I learnt how to calculate the time complexity and why it matters very much.
